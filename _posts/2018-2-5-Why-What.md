title: Why/What

For my first post, we're simply going to talk about what this site is for and what technologies I used.

I wanted to start this site mainly as a way for me to keep myself motivated toward developing things, and just doing things in general in my life. Writing has always been a nice creative outlet for me (whether I'm actually good at it or not - don't tell me). So this will be used as a creative outlet for me, as well as with somewhat blunt tutorials mixed in. Don't expect this to be a complete step-by-step tutorial site. Don't expect a diary. Expect ... well, I guess we'll figure that out.

Moving onto the technologies I used - I kept it pretty simple. I was originally thinking of using some sort of CMS or CMS-like framework like WordPress or Craft CMS. Instead ... I chose Jekyll. I ended up with it and not a CMS for multiple reasons. 

1. This site is meant to be used primarily as a creative outlet. I don't want to constantly be fiddling plugins, upgrades, quirks, random white page errors (looking @ you WordPress), and everything else that CMS's bring to the table along with what they actually do well. 
2. I wanted to not spend a dime. This site is statically generated using Jekyll, and hosted using Github Pages. This means absolutely no hosting fees. The only money fished over was $10 for the domain name.
3. I'm sooooo, soooooooooooo fucking sick of trying to get the best out of WordPress. WordPress is the 1st thing I ever did any real web development with, and I thank it for that. But WordPress is such a bloated framework that has to rely on buggy plugins that create even more bloat, bugginess, security issues, and reliance on developers that often times don't seem interested in continued development of their plugins. On the other hand, I really like Craft CMS, but I still didn't need the bloat a full CMS ([If you haven't, really check it out if you need a CMS](https://craftcms.com/)).
4. PHP feels sort of antiquated to me right now. It was the first real language I tried, and I really burnt myself out creating so many WordPress themes and plugins.
5. I've never used Jekyll or Github Pages before. I was really interested in finally using a project that integrated the both of them.

At the end of the day, I just wanted something that would work without much effort or money. So far Jekyll seems great for that. Maybe I end up moving this to a full CMS at some point - and if I do, I'll be sure to write about it.
