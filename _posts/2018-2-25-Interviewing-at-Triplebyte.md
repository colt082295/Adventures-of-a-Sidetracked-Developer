title: Interviewing at Triplebyte
---

I recently had a job interview at [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com/iv/W0qGaRu/cp). If you don't know, they're a company that fast-tracks you to interviews with companies based solely on your programming skills - no resume, work history, etc. It's truly a great idea for a company that's trying to make a space with iffy hiring stages better.

So I had my interview with them last week. I had prepped by studying core Javascript fundamentals, and developing a tic-tac-toe game in React over and over. This ended up not working out out well for me. The previous interview experiences I had found online said that they built tic-tac-toe, or were at least given that as a choice of options. This was not the case for me.

1st we started by talking a bit about my history, and then quickly went into the coding stage. It's when I got here that I was told I had to make a Trello clone. All my previous work at creating a tic-tac-toe game instantly gets thrown out the window, and I'm trying to think of how I would design this clone from the ground up. The problem is, that isn't how Triplebyte's process works. They turn the whole project into timed sections. This was the main gripe I had with this interview. Going curated step-by-step made me write code completely differently than I ever would. Normally you're given a problem, and you create your own steps. This really threw me off and had me going back and completely changing code I had that was designed for a different section. This combined with my anxiety of being timed really threw me off balance. I ended up doing well on about the 1st half of it, and getting stuck a lot in the 2nd half.

After the coding portion, we moved on to a Q & A section. This covered pretty much everything from HTTP, CSS, Security, cookies, databases, etc. I had been hoping that it had been more Javascript-focused. I was completely wrong in that assumption, and very little was actually JS based. Still, I felt I did fairly well on this section.

The final section was a system design question. Given a friend that scraped multiple websites for ~40,000 used cars, explain how you would make a website that would incorporate them. They told me I did very well in this section. I basically explained what technologies I would use and why (React, MongoDB, GraphQL, Node.js, etc.). I thought this was a pretty good question, and allowed me to really plan out my process.

All in all, I enjoyed the interview. I very much appreciated the evaluation emailed to me. I wish I would have studied differently and didn't assume what the coding portion would entail, but what are you gonna do? I also wish that I would have had more of an opportunity to show my knowledge of algorithms. In their evaluation email, they said I knew them poorly, but I don't recall ever going over any other than a binary search tree.

So my advice for people interviewing with Triplebyte?

 - Practice small scale programming in general, and not any particular type of app.
 - Get a broader knowledge of how the web works - HTTP, security, CSS, etc. Don't expect your typical FizzBuzz-type questions.
 - Be able to explain how you would make a web app from the ground up, and why you chose certain options.

And my advice to Triplebyte? Have more available options for programmers to show how they do their work. Rather than trying to fit the interviewee into your system, fit into their's.
